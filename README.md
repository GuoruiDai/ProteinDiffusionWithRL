# ProteinDiffusionWithRL
Diffusion model for protein generation with reinforcement learning finetuning

An attempt at using reinforcement learning to finetune a trained protein diffusion model, such that the finetuned model can generate proteins with lower energy on average. (This repo will not be further developed)
